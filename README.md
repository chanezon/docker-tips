# P@ Docker Tips

<img src="/img/docker-tips-medium.png"/>

After being a Docker user for a long time, [focusing mainly on Docker on Azure](https://github.com/chanezon/azure-linux/), I [joined Docker Inc](http://blog.docker.com/2015/03/chanezon-dockerized/). Discussing with engineers, I realized there are many undocumented tips and best practices they use daily that could benefit the Docker user community. I will try to document as many as I can in this repository.

* [Using Kubernetes in Docker for Mac](kube/README.md)
* [Running Graphical applications in Docker for Mac](x11/README.md)
* [Container Orchestration using Docker tools: Engine, Swarm, Machine, Compose](orchestration-networking/README.md)
* [Azure Resource Manager Template to provision a Docker Universal Control Plane cluster](azure-acs-ucp/README.md)
* [Using docker-machine to try out the latest versions of Docker](docker-machine-docker-latest.md)
* [Using a Volume for Maven cache when compiling Java in a container](java-build-mount-maven-repo.md)
